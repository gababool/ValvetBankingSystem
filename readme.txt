V.A.L.V.E.T. Banking System (Finished 5/1/2023)
........................................................
Course: DIT094 - Mini Project: Team Programming
........................................................
V.A.L.V.E.T. is a fictional banking system created during
the first project course of the Software Engineering
and Management programme at The University of Gothenburg.

We project was made using the OpenUP project process in
10 weeks/iterations for the course DIT094. The course
did not only include programming, but was centered around
agile development and project management, which included
various tools and models. For example, a Work-Breakdown
Structure, a Gantt chart, Risk Management/Monitoring,
Time and Effort Monitoring, etc.

Additionally, a user manual was created using technical
writing and finally the software was presented to the
rest of the class.

Notes:
- The precursors to this course was DIT043 - Object-oriented
Programming and DIT022 - Mathemathical Foundations for
Software Engineering.
- Restriction: JSON files were used for storing data, since the
data management course is scheduled for next semester.
- No software development lectures were held during the
course since they were only covering project management.
Therefore, JavaFx with SceneBuilder and JSON-storage using
the Jackson library had to be learned without guidance.
Because of this, some parts of the codebase may not be
following best-practice regarding these areas.
